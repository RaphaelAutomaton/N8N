# AI Automation Projects – Personal n8n Workflows

This repository contains personal automation workflows I've built using **n8n**, **OpenAI**, **Google Sheets**, and external APIs like **WhatsApp Evolution API**.

While these projects were originally created for personal and internal use, they demonstrate my practical experience with building lean, business-focused automations—aligned with the type of work described by Lake House Group.
